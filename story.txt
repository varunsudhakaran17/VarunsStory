Once there was a man named Paul that had been my teacher and my mentor for many years. One year I had tried to make a resume and a cover letter for an internship. My mentor told me that this time that I was complete this individually and I must learn myself on how to be professional and not always rely on someone.I spent hours and hours on that resume and cover letter for this prestigious internship, but I took this as an opportunity to better myself and to focus on strengthening my weaknesses. The deadline was approaching and I was beginning to get stressed and frustrated. Maybe that this was too much for me and I couldn't do it.
